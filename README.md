# World of Warships shader (fx) files backup

WG has recently started to use new fx s, which have different logic to render certain materials.
In their current state, we can't reproduce the same texture that we are using on our skins.

So I make this repository to stock the files that we have at the moment. If on day WG remove them from the client, we will need these files to make our skins work.

Declaration: I don't own any of these files, they are Wargaming's intellectual properties. This repository is only for storage propose.
